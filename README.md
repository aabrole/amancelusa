The wordpress and hosting configuration added some extra time on top of my 90 minutes allotted so with that being said I 
took your word in the email and didn't really look to develop content further and get it in before the end of the workday today. 

If I had more time I would've either went forth and make my wordpress site compatible with bootstrap (or just used that entirely) 
so I could use the grid layout when displaying styling and media but also make the page more responsive with a 
toggleable menu/sidebar, one page scroll navigation, and possibly some kind of gallery/carousel display. This could be done 
by using certain combination of plugins too (shortcode,elemental,block editor, etc) , although because this
is a custom theme created by me although there isn't a guarentee that all of them would work together/produce an accurate result.
